  <p class="internet">Internet Safety Tips</p>
  <p class="safety_tips">Computers create records of everything you do on the computer and on the internet.<br><br>

If you are in danger, try to use a safe computer where someone abusive does not have direct access, including remote (hacking) access. <br>For example, it may be safer to use a computer in a public library, at a community technology center (go to www.ctcnet.org for a national <br>directory), at a trusted friend’s house, or at an internet cafe.<br><br>

If you think your activities are being monitored, you are probably right. Abusive people are often controlling and want to know your every<br>move. You don’t need to be a computer programmer or have special skills to monitor someone’s computer activities. There are many ways<br> to monitor activities that anyone can easily access and use.<br><br>

Computers can provide a lot of information about what you look at on the internet, the e-mails you send, and other activities. It is not possible<br> to completely delete or clear all computer “footprints.”<br><br>

If you think you may be monitored on your home computer, you might consider no home internet use or only using your home internet to surf<br> for things that are more “safe.” For example, if you are planning to flee to California, don’t look at classified ads for jobs and apartments or bus<br> tickets for California on a home computer or any other computer your abuser has physical or remote access to. Use a safer computer to<br> research an escape plan.<br><br>

Remember, e-mail is not a safe or confidential way to talk to someone about the danger or abuse in your life. Instead try to use a “corded”<br> phone to call 911 or a domestic violence hotline. Corded phones are more private than cell phones. The Minnesota Domestic Violence Crisis<br> Line number is 866-223-1111; the National Domestic Violence Hotline number is 800-799-SAFE.<br><br>

Your phone’s location is trackable. To turn off location services on your phone, go to settings and turn off “location services.” This may look<br> different depending on your phone. If you are unsure of how to disable location services on your phone, contact your phone provider and they<br> can walk you through the process, step-by-step.<br><br>
